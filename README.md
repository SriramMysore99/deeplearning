## Welcome to the public Repository of Labellerr

Labellerr is a One Stop Automated AI training and Data Annotation SAAS platform for Computer Vision, Voice and NLP solutions. Our goal is to provide organizations a tool so that they can focus more on building AI models quickly rather than waiting on any third party services. Specially designed for machine learning researchers, AI software developers, big data engineers & data scientists whose need is to label millions & billions of datasets in a shorter duration with minimal effort. With Labellerr you can annotate data in any form such as image, text, audio files, video, documents, geospatial, MRI etc by first converting it from unstructured/semi-structured to structured format.
